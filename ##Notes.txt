## Pulsars are the neutron beams formed when   
     stars experience supernova explosion or tending  
     to experince due to which a high freq. neutron 
     beam forms with increased magnetic intensity   
     (magnetic   flux) and gravitational intensity   
     when two star collide together to result a   
     supernove explosion.

## astronomical images are saved in format .fits(FITS             
   IMAGES).also softwares ds9 and laden are used to       
   open this type of file.

## The unit of flux density is Jy(jenystein)
     and 1Jy = 1 x 10e-26 w/m^2-Hz
     w= watt, m=metre and Hz=Hertz

## sample sources and their respective flux density..
               Source            |      Flux Density(in Jy)
  ==========================================================
    1. Mobile phone              |     110,000,000
    2.Sun at 10 GHz              |     4,000,000
    3.Milky way at 10GHz         |     2,000
    4.Crab pulsar at 1.4 GHz     |     0.01


## How much memory can be used to store 600,000 images       
     of 200 x 200px?
 ==> 1 image = 200 x 200 px = 40,000 px
     and 1 pixel = 8 byte
     so total memory = 600,000 x 40,000 x 8 bytes =192GB

    **also if images does not consist of very important data         
      then alternatively we can resize all images to 50 x 50px
      and the memory size will be reduced by factor of 4
      i.e onle 16GB of memory will be used

## Every different type of object emits radiation of 
     different frequency.(see the image "big data make things slow.png")

## Astronomers uses astronomical telescopes and many 
    optical devices to allocate these frequencies of 
    different scale.

## In contrast, radio emission, at centimeter to meter 
     wavelengths, occurs when, for example, electrons are
     accelerated in magnetic fields, and can show us when 
     massive shocks are occurring in space.

## Here's an example of what you get when you 
     find a match in optical and radio, and combine  
     that information together.Hercules A, 
     a radio galaxy 643 megaparsecs, or 2,100 million 
     light years away. Remember, in cosmological terms, 
     that makes it a pretty near neighbor.
     You can clearly see the core of the galaxy 
     where the supermassive black hole is located,
     the powerful jets transporting energy to the outskirts 
     of the galaxy and beyond. And the massive lobes of 
     old radio emission from previous cycles of activity.
     In the optical image, you can see the stars that 
     make up the elliptical galaxy 3c348.(see image "hercules.png")
