## Pulsars are the neutron beams formed when   
   stars experience supernova explosion or tending  
   to experince due to which a high freq. neutron 
   beam forms with increased magnetic intensity   
  (magnetic   flux) and gravitational intensity   when two star collide together to result a   supernove explosion.

## astronomical images are saved in format .fits(FITS             
   IMAGES).also softwares ds9 and laden are used to       
   open this type of file.

## The unit of flux density is Jy(jenystein)
   and 1Jy = 1 x 10e-26 w/m^2-Hz
   w= watt, m=metre and Hz=Hertz

## sample sources and their respective flux      density..
                  Source            |      Flux Density(in Jy)
     ==========================================================
       1. Mobile phone              |     110,000,000
       2.Sun at 10 GHz              |     4,000,000
       3.Milky way at 10GHz         |     2,000
       4.Crab pulsar at 1.4 GHz     |     0.01


## How much memory can be used to store 600,000 images       
   of 200 x 200px?
 ==> 1 image = 200 x 200 px = 40,000 px
     and 1 pixel = 8 byte
     so total memory = 600,000 x 40,000 x 8 bytes =192GB

    **also if images does not consist of very important data         
      then alternatively we can resize all images to 50 x 50px
      and the memory size will be reduced by factor of 4
      i.e onle 16GB of memory will be used
