We'll start with an easy question to check everything is working.

Write a function calculate_mean that calculates the mean of a list of numbers. Your function should take a single argument, the list of floats, and return the mean of that list, like this:


>>> calculate_mean([1, 2.2, 0.3, 3.4, 7.9])
2.96
We'll test your function on different lists, so make sure it works for the general case. Here's another example of how it should work:


>>> calculate_mean([1.2, 3.8, 2.2, 8.2, 7.1])
4.5
Your solution cannot use the builtin statistics module.

Make sure your program works for negative numbers as well. We will not test your program with an empty list.

Remember the testing trick!
In Grok, you must only submit your function definition. Your program must not print any output. To test your function, use the __name__ == '__main__' trick, like this:

  

  print(double(5))
def double(a):
  return a*2
  
if __name__ == '__main__':
  # run your tests in here
  print(double(5))
Everything in this if statement will be ignored by the marker.
